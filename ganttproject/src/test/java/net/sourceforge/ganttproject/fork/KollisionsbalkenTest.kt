/**
 * THE COLLISION BAR — where it belongs and, above all, where it must NOT be.
 *
 * `hiddenTaskGaps` is the whole decision: what is a gap, how many gaps a run of hidden tasks makes,
 * and which row seam a gap sits on. It is a pure function over the document order and the row list,
 * so all of it can be checked here without a chart, a canvas or a screen. The drawing of it is
 * checked in `KollisionsbalkenZeichnerTest` (the connection) and `KollisionsbalkenBildTest` (the
 * picture).
 *
 * THE TWO CHECKS THIS FILE EXISTS FOR are `a view that hides nothing has no gap` and
 * `a collapsed summary task is not a gap`. Both are GREEN before the change, and both were made
 * sharp by breaking the finished code on purpose, more than once each — see the report of
 * 08.09.2026, section „Die Brueche".

/**
 * The edge cliff at the head and the tail of the document order.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS ABOUT. Everything the task table hides gets no row in the chart, and that alone is
 * right for anything in the MIDDLE of the plan: VerticalPartitioning.build skips it between the
 * first and the last visible row. At the HEAD and at the TAIL it does not: there the hidden task
 * lands in aboveViewport or belowViewport, gets an invisible rectangle at row -1 or row n+1
 * (GanttChartSceneBuilder.renderTasksAboveAndBelowViewport), and DependencySceneBuilder draws a
 * dependency line to it, because it only drops a line when BOTH ends are invisible
 * (DependencySceneBuilder.java:153). The result is a line running to the edge of the chart towards
 * something that is not there.
 *
 * The first measurement derived this from the source and called it the only place where it would
 * like to see a program run. No program is run here, but the partitioning itself is -- with real
 * tasks and the real hierarchy, and both directions of the failure.

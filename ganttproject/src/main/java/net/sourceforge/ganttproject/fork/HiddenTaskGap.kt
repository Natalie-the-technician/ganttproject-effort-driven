/**
 * [fork change] THE COLLISION BAR — the mark that says „something is missing here".
 *
 * Natalie, 08.09.2026: „wenn man eine ansicht hat die nicht alle Vorgänge zeigt und es eine Lücke
 * gibt das dort der kollisionsbalken liegt und anzeigt das hier eine Lücke ist weil es einen
 * Vorgang gibt den man gerade nicht sieht."
 *
 * WHAT IT IS FOR: honesty of the picture. A named view or a filter removes rows from the task
 * table, and the chart draws exactly the rows the table has ([GanttChartSceneBuilder.renderVisibleTasks]
 * counts them off one by one). What is left is a picture in which a stretch of time simply looks
 * empty, and nothing in it says that the emptiness is a consequence of the view rather than of the
 * plan. This mark is the missing sentence.
 *
 * ═══ WHAT COUNTS AS A GAP, AND WHY IT IS NOT „EVERY TASK THAT IS NOT A ROW" ═══
 *
 * A task can be missing from the row list for two quite different reasons, and only one of them is
 * a lie:
 *
 *  * ITS PARENT IS COLLAPSED. The parent IS on the chart, its summary bar spans the whole subtree,
 *    and the triangle in the table says out loud that there is more underneath. Nothing is being
 *    concealed; a mark here would be noise on a picture that is already telling the truth. Worse,
 *    it would appear every time anybody collapses anything, which is the most common action there
 *    is in this table.
 *  * A VIEW OR A FILTER TOOK IT OUT. Now nothing on the chart stands for it, and the stretch of
 *    time it occupied looks free.
 *
 * TELLING THE TWO APART WITHOUT ASKING THE COLLAPSE STATE. The obvious test is to ask the task
 * whether it is expanded. `Task.expand` CANNOT BE ASKED: M1 §2.3 measured that the JavaFX task
 * table never calls `setExpand`, so the model field is frozen at whatever was loaded from the file
 * while the truth lives in the UI map `TreeCollapseView`, which the chart renderer has no way to
 * reach. A collision bar built on `Task.expand` would appear under every summary task the user
 * collapses during the session.
 *
 * SO THE ROW LIST IS ASKED INSTEAD, and it answers without any state at all. For a task that is not
 * a row, find the nearest ancestor that IS a row:
 *
 *  * NO SUCH ANCESTOR — nothing on the chart stands for this task. GAP.
 *  * THERE IS ONE, and it has at least one descendant among the rows: it is therefore drawn
 *    expanded, its subtree is on the chart, and this task was taken out of a sequence that is
 *    otherwise shown. GAP.
 *  * THERE IS ONE, and NOTHING of its subtree is a row: it is collapsed — or the view has removed
 *    every one of its children, which looks exactly the same from here. NO GAP.
 *
 * THE LAST LINE IS THE ONE PLACE THIS GUESSES, and it guesses towards silence: a view that hides
 * every child of a shown summary task gets no mark. That is a miss, not a false alarm, and it is
 * the harmless direction — the summary bar still spans the time, so the picture is not empty where
 * the work is. A mark that appeared under every collapsed task, the other way round, would be a
 * false alarm on the most ordinary action in the program and would teach the user to ignore it.
 *
 * ═══ ONE BAR PER GAP, NOT ONE PER TASK ═══
 *
 * Three hidden tasks in a row are ONE gap. [hiddenTaskGaps] therefore groups maximal RUNS of
 * consecutive hidden tasks in the document order, and each run becomes one [HiddenTaskGap] spanning
 * from the earliest start to the latest end within it. A hidden summary task and its subtree are
 * consecutive by construction — the document order is depth first — so a hidden subtree is one run
 * as well.
 *
 * [count] counts every task in the run, the children of a hidden summary task included. That is the
 * honest answer to „how many tasks am I not seeing here"; counting only the roots of the run would
 * report 1 for a hidden phase of forty tasks.
 *
 * ═══ THE NAMES ARE NOT IN IT, AND THAT IS A DECISION ═══
 *
 * [HiddenTaskGap] carries a count and two dates and NO names, and the tooltip built from it names
 * nothing either. A view is a deliberate act of leaving something out; a chart that whispers the
 * names undoes exactly the act the user asked for, and it does so in the one place where they
 * cannot switch it off. The bar's job is to stop a false reading of the picture, not to restore the
 * content — whoever wants the content switches the view off, which is one click away. Two dates and
 * a count say „look again with the view off" without being the view.
 *
 * ═══ THE ONE PRECONDITION ═══
 *
 * The row index of a gap is a position in the DOCUMENT ORDER, so it only means anything while the
 * chart draws the rows in that order too. `TaskTable.onSort` fills the row list in SORT order
 * (TaskTable.kt:262-278), and then „the seam between row k-1 and row k" has no relation to the
 * document order at all. [hiddenTaskGaps] detects that case by comparing the row list with the
 * document order projection and returns NO gaps — a mark in the wrong place would be worse than
 * none, because it would name a gap that is not there.
 */

 * checked without a chart, a canvas or a screen.
 *
 * ON THE SEAM, NOT IN A ROW. The gap is a hole in the SEQUENCE of rows, so the mark sits on the
 * line between row [HiddenTaskGap.rowIndex]-1 and row [HiddenTaskGap.rowIndex] -- the very place
 * where the tasks were taken out. That line already exists (`renderVisibleTasks` draws a grey one
 * there), it is the only horizontal strip of a row that never carries a task bar, and a mark there
 * belongs to neither of the two rows it separates, which is right: it belongs to what is between
 * them.
 *
 * THE ALTERNATIVE WAS A NARROW MARK AT THE EDGE OF THE CHART, and it was rejected because it
 * answers only half of Natalie's sentence. „es eine Lücke gibt" is a hole in the picture at a
 * PLACE IN TIME; a mark at the edge says that something is missing somewhere and leaves the reader
 * to guess where. Lying across the days the hidden tasks occupy, the mark says „the emptiness you
 * are looking at, right here, is not empty".
 *
 * THE FIRST ROW IS THE ONE SPECIAL CASE. Its seam is y = 0, and half the mark would reach above the
 * chart area into the timeline header. It is pushed down to y = 0 instead. In the narrowest row the
 * chart draws, that leaves it 4 pixels before the first task bar and it overlaps the top edge of
 * that bar by one pixel; the mark is drawn BEFORE all bars (see `GanttChartSceneBuilder.render`), so
 * the bar wins that pixel and nothing visible is covered.
 *
 * @param leftX, @param rightX the days of the gap, already measured against the chart's own day
 *        columns by the caller's [biz.ganttproject.core.chart.grid.OffsetLookup].
 * @param rowHeight the height of one chart row in pixels.

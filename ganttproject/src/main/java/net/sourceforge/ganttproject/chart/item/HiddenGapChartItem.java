/**
 * [fork change] What the pointer is over when it rests on a COLLISION BAR.
 *
 * ITS TASK IS NULL, and that is not an omission. A gap stands for tasks the view was asked to leave
 * out; naming one of them here would put it into the tooltip, into the status bar and into every
 * other place that asks a chart item what task it belongs to. There is no task under this mark —
 * that is the whole statement it makes.
 *
 * `MouseMotionListenerImpl` therefore finds it in the branch for „no task under the pointer", right
 * beside the calendar events, which are the other thing on this chart that is not a task.

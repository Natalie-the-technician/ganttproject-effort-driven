/**
 * Named views for large plans.
 *
 * A view is a NAMED SET OF HIDDEN TASKS. Several of them live side by side in one project, only one
 * is active at a time, and the active one is a second condition next to the task filter -- see
 * TaskTable.doSync. Hiding a summary task takes its whole subtree along, because SyncAlgorithm does
 * not descend into a node it did not create.
 *
 * WHY THE SET HOLDS WHAT IS HIDDEN AND NOT WHAT IS SHOWN. This is the single most important
 * decision of the design. A task created after a view was saved appears in no view's hidden set,
 * so it stays VISIBLE in every view. The other direction -- a list of what is shown -- would make
 * every newly created summary task invisible in every named view at once, without a word. The wrong
 * direction of the two possible errors.
 *
 * WHY ONE OPTION FOR ALL VIEWS, ENCODED. The reader of a project file matches option ids against a
 * list that is built BEFORE the file is read (ProxyDocument:224 -> TaskSerializer.kt:243). An
 * `<option id="view.Rohbau">` would find no counterpart and would be dropped without a message. So
 * all views have to travel in ONE option, and that means a grammar of our own. The grammar is the
 * one GPCloudStorageOptions has been using since 2018: "\n" between records, "\t" between fields.
 * Measured, not assumed: a multi-line CDATA survives the SAX writer and the Jackson reader
 * unchanged -- see TaskViewsRoundTripTest.

/**
 * Resource IDs are numbered from 0 in every project file which GanttProject writes. Two files which
 * were created independently therefore collide on resource #0 by construction, even though they
 * describe different people. With the duplicate detection defaulting to "by ID", importing such a
 * file replaced a resource of the target project: its name, mail, phone, role and pay rate were
 * overwritten with the values of a stranger, the assignments of the target project kept pointing at
 * that record, and nothing was reported to the user.
 *
 * These tests use a freshly constructed {@link MergeResourcesOption}, that is, they test the
 * *default* value of the option. A user who explicitly chooses "by ID" still gets the overwriting
 * behaviour; that is covered by {@code TestImportResources#testMergeByID}.

/*
 * Resource levelling: moves tasks later so that no resource is booked over its capacity on any working day.
 *
 * The scheduler places every task as early as its dependencies allow and does not look at resources at all. This
 * calculation does, and it knows no project types: it works with LocalDate and plain values, and the calendar comes
 * in as a function, so that it can be tested without a project.
 *
 * Rules:
 *  - tasks are placed in dependency order; of the tasks which are ready, the one with higher priority goes first,
 *    and on equal priority the one which is higher in the plan;
 *  - several tasks may run on the same day as long as each resource stays within its capacity;
 *  - a fixed date stays, and so does frozen work; if they overload a resource, the overload is reported, not resolved;
 *  - a deadline is not enforced either, a task which ends after it is reported;
 *  - a task is never split, it runs on consecutive working days;
 *  - a task is placed only where all of its blocking resources are present; if there is no such window, or no window
 *    with room, it stays on its earliest day and this is reported.
